# data-512-a1: Visualizing Wikipedia Traffic

## Goal

The goal of this project is to create a visualization of page views of Wikipedia pages from 2008 to 2018 from various sources like mobile and desktop computers. This project follows best practices for open scientific research and helps ensure that everything detailed here is fully reproducible.

## Sources of Data

All data used in this project was sourced from two APIs. The first API is the Wikipedia Pagecounts API. This is an old API endpoint that was discontinued in July 2016. The legacy API doesnt differentiate between views caused by spiders vs those generated by actual views. 

The endpoint for the legacy pagecounts API is given below:

https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/#!/Pageviews_data/get_metrics_pageviews_aggregate_project_access_agent_granularity_start_end

Documentation for this API is shown below:

https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Analytics/AQS/Legacy_Pagecounts

Traffic from January 2008 to July 2016 can be accessed using this API.



This legacy API was superceded by a new API called the Pageviews API. This API provides the user with more granularity and allows them to choose what kind of traffic they're interested in. It was used to get data from July 2015 to September 2018.

The endpoint for this API is shown below:

https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/#!/Pageviews_data/get_metrics_pageviews_aggregate_project_access_agent_granularity_start_end

Documentation for this API can be found at the following URL:

By using these APIs, you agree to the Wikimedia Rest API terms and conditions. These can be found on the link shown below:
